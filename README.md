# Win Condition

Originally, this project used a precalculated collection of boxes to check if something was a win or not.

On the `win-condition` branch, I'm trying out a simple way of checking for a win that isn't as hard coded, as part of keeping things generic and being able to make it potentially a larger board or Connect Four.
